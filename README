Notes:
    This updated approach was used to demonstrate an understanding of object-oriented programming concepts and code re-usability.
    Clips are now stored in Clip objects.
    The CustomFilter class, which extends the FilterIterator class, was re-designed to be agnostic to the type of items it is filtering.
    The CustomFilter can now accept a list of filters and tests to see if every item being iterated over passing every filter in the list.
    Additionally, the ClipHandler is used to handle building Clip objects and passing a list of Clips to the CustomFilter. 

To run vimeo.php:
    Ensure that clips.csv is in the same directory as vimeo.php.
    Ensure you are using PHP 5 to run this file. More specifically, this was written using PHP 5.5.9.

Running clip_filter.php will create two new files in the same directory: valid.csv and invalid.csv.
